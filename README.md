# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero. The `foo` function in `bug.js` attempts to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, but fails to handle the case where both are zero.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that fully addresses this issue by adding a check for both values being zero.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the code using Node.js or a web browser console.
4. Observe the error message.
